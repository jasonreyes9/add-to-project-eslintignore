# @actions/add-to-project

**ðŸš¨ This action is a work in progress. Please do not use it except for experimentation until a release has been prepared. Thanks!**

Use this action to automatically add issues to a project when they're opened.

```yaml
name: Add to project

on:
  issues: {types: [opened]}

jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue to project
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v1
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/<orgName>/projects/<projectNumber>
          github-token: ${{ secrets.ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT }}
          labeled: bug
```

Note that the `github-token` input must be a personal access token with
`read:org`, `write:org` (to get and update projects) and `repo` scope (for
adding repo issues to the project).

The `labeled` key is optional, and if specified, the action will only add issues
that have at least one of the specified labels. This should be a comma-delimited
string of label names.

## Code in Main

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy. This won't work with versions older than 9, for instance.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:

```bash
$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
...
```

## Change action.yml

The action.yml defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)

## Change the Code

Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

```javascript
import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try {
      ...
  }
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
```

See the [toolkit documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages) for the various packages.

## Publish to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run [ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) and push the results:

```bash
$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

Note: We recommend using the `--license` option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! :rocket:

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)

## Validate

You can now validate the action by referencing `./` in a workflow in your repo (see [test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml))

```yaml
uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
```

See the [actions tab](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions) for runs of this action! :rocket:

## Usage:

After testing you can [create a v1 tag](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md) to reference the stable and latest V1 action
